### 📅 Day 1 – Python Fundamentals: Variables, Input/Output & Arithmetic

#### 📘 Topics Covered:
- Declaring and using variables (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)
- Multiple variable assignment and swapping
- Type Conversion (casting): `int()`, `float()`, `str()`
- Input from user using `input()`
- Output using `print()` and `f-strings`
- Arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
  - Floor Division (`//`)
  - Modulus (`%`)
  - Exponentiation (`**`)

#### 🧠 Practice Programs:
- Add two numbers entered by user
- Greet the user using their name and age
- Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
- Calculate Simple Interest: `SI = (P × R × T) / 100`
